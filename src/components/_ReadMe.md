All components are available publicly so there is no need to import them;

*** Structure: ***
- atoms
-- icons
- molecules
- organisms
- templates

Components "sitting" on the base structure are available by their name: <HButton>, <HFooter>, <HMedia> etc.
Components on the subfolders will be rendered as SubfolderComponent: <IconCart>, <IconX> etc.

publically and is used only to compliment global component.
